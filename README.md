# Fake news detection ðŸ“°

## About the project ðŸ”Ž
In this notebook, I use machine learning techniques (linear regression, decision tree classification, and gradient boost) 
to detect fake news.

The project is guided by yobots, whose corresponding YouTube video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X27excCyXk&ab_channel=yobots).
